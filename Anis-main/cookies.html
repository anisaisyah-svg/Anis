<p><u>Easy Chocolate Chip Cookies</em></u></p>

<p>This simple recipe makes the best chocolate chip cookies, and since it uses melted butter, there’s no need for a stand mixer, beating butter, or chilling.

I’ve made these chocolate chip cookies so many times that I have memorized the recipe. They are chewy in the middle with the most perfect golden brown edges.</p>


<i>My approach to learning how to draw is that even if you have no idea how to do this, you can get really decent after a while if you learn the basic concepts techniques and if you practice regularly. So let’s take a look.</i>

<h3>Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients</h3>

<li>Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
<li>Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
<li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
<li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
<li>Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up</li>
<li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
<li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
<li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
<li>Nuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li>
